# Delete Duplicate Vercel Project

## Both Projects Connected to Same Repo

Since both projects are connected to `chaincheung/portfolio-redesign`, you need to delete one.

## Step-by-Step to Decide:

### Step 1: Compare Both Projects

**Project 1:**
- Project name: __________
- URL: __________
- Last deployment status: ☐ Success ☐ Failed
- Has custom domain? ☐ Yes ☐ No
- Deployment date: __________

**Project 2:**
- Project name: __________
- URL: __________
- Last deployment status: ☐ Success ☐ Failed
- Has custom domain? ☐ Yes ☐ No
- Deployment date: __________

### Step 2: Pick Which to Keep

**Keep the one with:**
- ✅ Successful deployments
- ✅ Your custom domain (if you have one)
- ✅ More recent activity
- ✅ Better/preferred URL

**Delete the other one.**

## Quick Decision:

**If they're identical:**
- Pick the one with the better URL name
- Or the more recent one
- Delete the other

**If one has custom domain:**
- **Keep that one** (it has your domain configured)
- Delete the other

**If one has successful deployments and one doesn't:**
- **Keep the one with successful deployments**
- Delete the failing one

**Delete whichever one you don't want, then verify deployments work with just one project!**
